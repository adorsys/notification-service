# Notification-server

Notification-server is a ready to use push notification server supporting multi-session and authentication. It was built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/). The main purpose of notification-server is to provide an **easy**, **stable** and **secure** solution which can be used to send push notifications to a client application.

## Version

1.0.0

## Features

* support for old browsers which do not support WebSockets
* REST JSON API
* authentication to API and push notification channels
* supports multi-session where the same user can be connected to the notification server from many applications and tabs at the same time
* easy to run
* easy to use

## How to run it

### Docker

#### Build the container

```sh
docker build -t notification-server .
```

#### Run the container

```sh
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  --name notification-server \
  -e "AUTH_TOKEN=<secret>" \
  notification-server:latest
```

> IMPORTANT:
> &lt;secret&gt; - has to be changed into a secure token which will be used as an
> authentication token to notification-server API from your backend application.

### Manual installation

* install Node.js and npm
* fetch the git repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/adorsys/notification-service.git
```

* install app dependencies using npm

```sh
npm install
```

* set env variable with the authentication token - this token will be used to secure access to REST API

```sh
export AUTH_TOKEN=your_secret
```

* run the server

```sh
npm start
```

## Is it working

Open the ```/api/status/info``` page, e.g. ```http//localhost:3000/api/status/info``` and the application should display the name and current version of the server.

## How to use it

We recommend that it is used in the following way but of course it can be modified :)

### Register a client app

> HEADER X-AUTH-TOKEN with the same value as the env variable AUTH_TOKEN of notification-server

1. Client app asks your backend about the connection data of the push notification channel (in most cases it will be executed after a successful authentication)
2. Your backend app generates a random `connectionId` - it should be unique and secure - we recommend UUID
3. Your backend app registers the user in notification-server executing the method:

   ```PUT /api/{userId}/register?connectionId={connectionId} with X-AUTH-TOKEN header```

   > IMPORTANT
   > where userId is the unique id of your user in your application we will use the
   > userId in the future to send one push notification to all clients of this user

4. Your backend app returns `connectionId` and `url` to notification-server to client app
5. Client app connects and authenticates to notification-server (using socket.io lib):

   ```js
   var socket = io.connect(notificationSocketIo.url);
   socket.on('connect', function() {
       socket.emit('register', userId,  notificationSocketIo.connectionId);
   });
   ```

6. Register client apps which are to receive push notifications. Use socket.io to listen to messages with an identifier `message`:

   ```js
   socket.on('message', function(msg) {
        //handle your message
   });
   ```

### Send a push notification

![Diagram of sending push notification](doc/images/send.png)

1. When your backend application wants to send a push notification to a client just execute:

   ```POST /api/{userId}/push with X-AUTH-TOKEN header```
  
   and send the content of the push notification message, format of message {"message": message_json}, e.g.

   ```json
   {
     "message": {
       "title":"Title of message",
       "body": "Body of message",
       "params": {}
     }
   }
   ```

2. Client app will receive a push notification in callback registered in step 6

### Disconnect

1. To stop receiving push notifications your client app has to execute:

   ```js
   socket.emit('disconnect')
   ```

## Security

### Access to api

There is a simple mechanism using `X-AUTH-TOKEN` header to authenticate your application in notification-server. Each request from your backend `e.g. /api/{userId}/register` and `/api/{userId}/push` requires this header. The token has to have the same value as the env variable `AUTH_TOKEN` of notification-server.

### Access to the push notification channel

The first thing a client application has to do after connecting is to register in notification-server. In order to do this it has to use the `connectionId` generated by the backend. Only registered applications will receive push notifications.

## Monitoring

You can execute `GET /api/status/ping` to check if the application is live.

You can execute `GET /api/status/info` to obtain the application's version.
